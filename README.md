## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'lob'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or manually install it yourself:

    $ gem install lob

## Usage

The library uses an ActiveRecord-style interface. You'll feel right at home.
You'll need a Lob.com API key. It's free and you can get yours [here](https://dashboard.lob.com/account).

For optional parameters and other details, refer the docs here - <https://lob.com/docs>

#### Caution: Pass zero-prefixed zip codes as strings

When using zip codes with zero-prefixes, always quote them. For example when specifying `02125`, pass it as a string `"02125"`, instead of an integer.

The Ruby interpreter assumes it's not of base-10 and tries to convert it to base-10 number. So that might result in an entirely different zip-code than intended.

## Supported Image Types

The lob.com API supports the following image types:

- PDF
- PNG
- JPEG

For more information on prepping the images please see the [Lob documentation](https://lob.com/docs#prepping)

#### Creating a PDF

If you need to generate your own PDF programmatically we recommend using [prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn). There is an example provided in the examples folder [here](examples/create_pdf.rb)

## Initialization and Configuration

```ruby
# To initialize a Lob object
@lob = Lob.load(api_key: "your-api-key")

# Alternatively, to set the API key for all calls in the future
Lob.api_key = "your-api-key"
@lob = Lob.load
```

#### Or if you want some detailed configuration

```ruby
Lob.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = "your-api-key"  # get your own at http://lob.com :)
  config.api_version = "v1"        # default version
  config.protocol = "https"        # default protocol
  config.api_host = "api.lob.com"  # ofcourse it's Lob
end
```

## Developing

Make sure you have Ruby 2.0 installed. Copy and paste the following commands in your projects directory.

    git clone https://github.com/lob/lob-ruby.git
    cd lob-ruby
    bundle install

You are powered up and ready to roll ~!

## Testing

To run the tests, download the required sample files by running the following command:

    bundle exec rake dev:setup

Tests are written using MiniTest, a testing library that comes with Ruby stdlib. The remote responses are tested using [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr).

You'll need to pass in your Lob.com API as the environment variable `LOB_API_KEY`, to run the tests. Be sure to use your Test API key, and not the Live one.

Here's how you can run the tests:

    LOB_API_KEY=your_test_api_key bundle exec rake test


When you make changes to failed tests, then clear out the vcr cassettes to re-record the http requests. You can clear out all the cassettes by running `rm -rf spec/vcr_cassettes`.

You can also configure, TravisCI for your fork of the repository and it'll run the tests for you, when you push.
